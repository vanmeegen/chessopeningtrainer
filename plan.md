# Chess Opening Trainer — Implementation Plan

## Agent Team Design

### Agent Roster

| Agent | Role | Core Skills | Tools/Libs |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| **🏗️ Scaffold** | Project bootstrapping & config | Vite, TS, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Vitest, Playwright setup | npm, vite, vitest, playwright |
| **♟️ ChessCore** | Chess logic layer & data types | chess.js, FEN/PGN/SAN parsing, move trees, type design | chess.js |
| **📦 DataPipeline** | Opening database build pipeline | TSV/JSON parsing, Wikibooks API, LLM annotation, static JSON generation | Node scripts, MediaWiki API |
| **🎨 UIComponents** | Presentational React components | React, react-chessboard, CSS, responsive layout, accessibility | react-chessboard, CSS modules |
| **🧠 StateModels** | MobX stores & presentation models | MobX, mobx-react-lite, business logic, model design | mobx, mobx-react-lite |
| **🔁 SM2Engine** | Spaced repetition system | SM-2 algorithm, IndexedDB, card lifecycle, session logic | idb (IndexedDB wrapper) |
| **🌐 PWAAgent** | Offline support & installability | Service workers, vite-plugin-pwa, caching strategies, manifest | vite-plugin-pwa |
| **🧪 E2EAgent** | End-to-end test coverage | Playwright, page object pattern, data-testid conventions | @playwright/test |
| **🔗 Integrator** | Cross-cutting wiring & final polish | Routing, navigation, theming, sound, responsive breakpoints | react-router, CSS variables |

### Agent Interaction Rules

- All agents follow **TDD** (write tests first, then implement)
- All agents use **MobX** for state, **never React hooks** for state management
- All agents define **explicit TypeScript types** (no inline types used in >1 place)
- **UIComponents** agent builds pure presentational components; all logic lives in models built by **StateModels**
- **E2EAgent** works after each increment to add Playwright coverage
- Each phase ends with: all tests green, build passes, **automated phase gate verification** (see below)

### Phase Gate Verification Protocol

Every phase concludes with an automated verification step — no manual user verification needed.
The **🧪 E2EAgent** executes the following gate checks using **Playwright MCP** (AI-driven browser interaction):

1. **Unit & lint gate:** Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` — all must pass
2. **Build gate:** Run `npm run build` — must succeed with zero errors
3. **E2E regression gate:** Run `npx playwright test` — all existing E2E tests must pass
4. **AI visual verification (Playwright MCP):** Use the Playwright MCP server to:
   - Launch the dev server and open the app in a browser
   - Navigate through all screens built in the current phase
   - Take screenshots at each key screen/state
   - Verify visual correctness: layout renders properly, no blank screens, no overlapping elements
   - Verify interactive behavior: click buttons, make moves on the board, confirm expected responses
   - Check responsive layout at phone (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px) widths
   - Verify no console errors appear during navigation
5. **Verification report:** The agent produces a structured pass/fail report:
   ```
   Phase X Gate Report
   ├── Unit tests:        ✅ PASS (N tests)
   ├── Lint:              ✅ PASS
   ├── Build:             ✅ PASS
   ├── E2E tests:         ✅ PASS (N tests)
   ├── Visual check:      ✅ PASS
   │   ├── HomeScreen:    ✅ renders correctly
   │   ├── SelectScreen:  ✅ renders correctly
   │   └── TrainScreen:   ✅ renders correctly
   ├── Interaction check: ✅ PASS
   │   ├── Navigation:    ✅ all routes work
   │   └── Board:         ✅ moves execute correctly
   ├── Responsive check:  ✅ PASS (375px, 768px, 1280px)
   └── Console errors:    ✅ NONE
   ```
6. **On failure:** The agent flags specific issues, takes a screenshot of the failure, and creates fix tasks before re-running the gate

### Phase Completion Protocol

After the gate verification passes, the following **must** happen before the next phase begins:

1. **Agent sync barrier:** Confirm **all agents** from the current phase have stopped working and returned their results. No agent from phase N may still be running when phase N+1 starts.
2. **Update plan.md:** Mark all completed tasks with ✅ checkmarks.
3. **Commit:** Create a git commit containing all work from the phase:
   - Run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` one final time to confirm green state
   - Stage all changed files
   - Commit with message: `feat: complete Phase N — <short description>`
   - Example: `feat: complete Phase 0 — project scaffold with Vite, TS, MobX, tooling`
4. **Continue:** Only after the commit succeeds, proceed to the next phase

**Note on Phases 3/4/5:** These run in parallel but share a single sync barrier.
All three must complete their individual gates before a combined commit is made.
Alternatively, if they finish at different times, each gets its own commit at its
own gate — the key constraint is that **no Phase 6 work starts until all three
are committed.**

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Presentation Model Pattern**: All logic in MobX models, React components are pure view layers
2. **On-demand data loading**: Opening catalog bundled, detail files fetched lazily
3. **IndexedDB for persistence**: Card states, preferences, session history via `idb` wrapper
4. **Static JSON pipeline**: Build-time scripts generate all opening data — no runtime server
5. **SM-2 as pure function**: Algorithm is a pure function, store handles persistence separately
6. **Three-tier move assessment**: Book / Playable / Inaccuracy based on database presence, not engine eval
